He also invites Mani and Mohan who can work only 1/5th as fast as he can to join him. If the five person team works the same job and they start together, how long will it take for them to finish the job?",

        "explanation": "Let the work be 100 units. Madhavan's 1 hour work = 100/5 = 20 units Manohar and Manjima's 1 day work = 3/4 × 20 = 15 units. Mohan and Mani's 1 day work = 1/5 × 20 = 4 units. In one day all five of them can do = 20 + 15 + 15 + 4 + 4 = 58 units of work. Hence they can complete the work in 100/58 days.",

So In 24 days, 43×8=344 units of work is completed. In the next 2 days, 13 unitsare completed and on 27th day, Santhosh takes 1/10 thof a day to finish the rest. So, gopal and vikash worked for 9 days each and have hence put in 36 and 81 units respectively, and the rest of the 243 units is put in by santhosh. The wages shall also be distributed in the same ratio as: Rs 36, Rs 81 and Rs 243.",
